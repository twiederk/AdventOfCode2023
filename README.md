|  [9] | [Mirage Maintenance]              | SOLVED | SOLVED      | history.sum() is not the same as history.all { it == 0 }, because of [-1, 1 ]                                                                                                                                               |
| [10] | [Pipe Maze]                       | SOLVED | SOLVED      | Reviewed solution of from [Day 10 of Todd Ginsberg], in particular form movement. This comment about [vector graphics] helped a lot for part 2                                                                              |

| [12] | [Hot Springs]                     | SOLVED | NO IDEA     | Solved part 1 with brute force. Don't think I will try part 2          .                                                                                                                                                    |
| [13] | [Point of Incidence]              | FAILED | NOT STARTED | Tried solving of part 1 two times. Don't think I will try it once more                                                                                                                                                      |
| [14] | [Parabolic Reflector Dish]        | SOLVED | SOLVED      | Solved part 1 by myself. Needed research for part two. Found help in this [Video from GODdev] and as always from [Day 14 of Todd Ginsberg].                                                                                 |
| [15] | [Lens Library]                    | SOLVED | SOLVED      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |   
| [16] | [The Floor Will Be Lava]          | SOLVED | SOLVED      | Needed help to realize that the beams could fully loop back on themselves. Again the solution form [Day 16 of Todd Ginsberg] gave me the hint. Used brute force for part 2. Luckily first edge I checked was the right one. |   

## Resources

## To Do
* Replace for-loop with streams everywhere
* Day05 optimize performance of part 2
* Day07 refactor strengthWithJoker
